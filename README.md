# Jakobshavn Isbrae Calving Statistics
Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding the statistical nature of glacier claving at Jakobshavn Isbrae in West Greenland. We will use satellite-derived terminus positions and surface velocities from the Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GrIMP) to create a glacier calving time series for Jakobshavn Isbrae. We will quantify calving through three key objectives: (1) using length change along the glacier’s center flow line (2) using area change across the terminus width to capture asymmetric events, and (3) analyzing the frequency and magnitude of claving events using statistical models (compound Poisson distribution). These objectives will improve our understanding of calving behavior and its representation in ice sheet models.
